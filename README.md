# Web-weather-app

This is my first real time Web-Application project using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT project.
In this project i have used my design for this app and the font are been chosen in term of UX/UI design.
In this project i used the open API Key offered by the Openweathermap where u can create a own api key to use in the web application.
This project still needs some updation in JAVASCRIPT code.
Still making this app updation in design and code.
I need some recommendation for some changes.
